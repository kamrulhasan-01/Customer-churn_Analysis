# 📉 Customer Churn Analysis Project (Ongoing - 1 Lakh+ Records)

## 📌 Project Overview

This is an ongoing end-to-end Customer Churn Analysis project based on a large dataset with over 1,00,000 customer records. The main objective is to analyze customer behavior, identify churn patterns, and eventually integrate predictive AI/ML models. The final project will include a Power BI dashboard, SQL queries, Python analysis scripts, and clear documentation.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Highlights

- Converted `TotalCharges` to numeric
- Handled missing/null values
- Removed duplicates
- Encoded categorical variables
- Treated outliers using IQR method

---

## 🔍 EDA Insights (So Far)

- Month-to-month contracts show high churn.
- Fiber optic users churn more.
- Electronic Check payments are linked with higher churn.
- Senior citizens and new users have higher churn rates.

---

## 🧠 Upcoming AI/ML Model Plans

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost
- Evaluation: Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, AUC

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard (Coming Soon)

- Overall churn overview
